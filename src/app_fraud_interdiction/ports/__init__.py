"""The hexagon's boundaries, re-exported once so there is a single import site.

Every port is a ``@runtime_checkable`` Protocol and every port has a binding in every profile
(``config.DEFAULT_BINDINGS``); ``tests/test_contract_parity.py`` asserts both, plus set equality
in the reverse direction so a port added here without a binding fails the build.

``IdentityPort`` is not redeclared: it comes from the shared ``hex-service-kit`` commons and is
re-exported here so consumers still have one import site for the boundary set. What an identity
adapter DECLARES about the authentication it provides is this service's own vocabulary, not the
commons', and lives in :mod:`.identity` next to the re-export.
